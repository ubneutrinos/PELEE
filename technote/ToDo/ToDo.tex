\section{Conclusions and Remaining To Do Items}
\label{sec:todo}

This note presented an analysis in advanced state, with significant statistical updates with respect to the first round of the MicroBooNE LEE analysis.

However, a few developments are currently only partially completed and will be fully integrated in the next weeks. These developments include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reprocess samples with updated/fixed CRT information. Once this is done, we will apply the CRT selection to the $\nu_e$ selections. We plan to keep the data sets with and without CRT separate and perform a simultaneous fit across them.
    \item Finalize the new constraint procedure, fully integrating it in the fitting framework.
    \item Include the new signal model in the fitting framework. 
\end{itemize}
