\section{Sidebands}
\label{sec:sidebands}

To validate the modelling of neutrino interactions in MicroBooNE and predicted sources of background, several sidebands are employed. These consist of the events selected by the muon neutrino constraint selection, events containing two or more reconstructed showers to study the $\pi^0$ induced backgrounds and shower energy estimation, and near/far sidebands created with combinations of higher energy/lower BDT scoring events. The selections used to obtain the near/far sidebands will be detailed in Section~\ref{sec:NearAndFarSideband}.

These comparisons are not only to ensure the overall data/simulation agreement, but stability in the behavior of the data and simulation across the different runs. To this end, we will study data to simulation comparisons from runs 1-3, runs 4-5, and runs 1-5, the first example of which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:NuMuSideband}.

\subsection{Near and Far Sidebands}
\label{sec:NearAndFarSideband}

The far sidebands are obtained by applying the full event selections for the signal channels, described in Appendix~\ref{appendix:1e0pSelection} and~\ref{appendix:1eNpSelection}, with blindness achieved through inversion of the BDT cuts, or only selecting events with reconstructed energies above the signal region. This approach is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:SidebandStructure}, in which the palest green squares represent the far sideband, while the slightly darker green is the near sideband. The definitions are slightly different for the 1e0p and 1eNp event selections. The variables that will be examined are the BDT response scores, and the reconstructed neutrino energy.
